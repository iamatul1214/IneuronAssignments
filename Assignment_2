1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Answer- The two values of bolean data type are True and False. Syntax= a=True, b=False
2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Answer- And , Or , Not
3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Answer- And = True And True= True
			  True And False=False
			  False And True=False
			  False And False=False
		Or =  True OR False=True
			  True OR True=True
			  False OR True=True
			  False OR False=False
		Not = Not True= False
			  Not False=True
4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) - False
not (5 > 4)          - False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)  - True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))- False
(True and True) and (True == False)- False
(not False) or (not True)     - True
5. What are the six comparison operators?
Answer- < , > , <= , >= , == , and != 
6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
Answer- for equal to we use '==' operator and for assignment we use '='. for eg- x=10 is an assignment and if x==10 is comparison.
  For comparing we use equal to and for assignment we use =.
7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')   Block 1 ends
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')  Block 2 ends
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')   Block 3 ends

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
if spam==1:
    print("Hello")
elif spam==2:
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Greetings!")

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
Answer- Ctrl + c
10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Answer- The break statement is used to terminate a loop in which it is called, and the statements  after body of loop is executed.
		The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the statements/code after the continue in current iteration of the loop.
11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Answer- range(10) means iterating from 0 till 10 times , which means 0 to 9.
		range(0,10) means iteration starting from 0 and ending on 10.
		range(0,10,1) means iteration starting from 0 and ending at 10 with increment of 1.
12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Answer- 
--------------------------------
	For loop
--------------------------------	
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)
---------------------------------	
	While loop
---------------------------------	
	i=1
while(i<=10):
    print(i)
    i+=1
13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
